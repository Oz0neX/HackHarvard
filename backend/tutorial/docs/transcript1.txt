I hired a caregiver to stay with my mom
while I'm at work. My mother becomes mean
and aggressive towards the caregiver
when she tries to get her ready in the
morning. Like mom yells at her to get out
and may even try to slap her away. It is
a daily struggle and the caregiver is
ready to quit. I can't be with my mom
every single minute and I don't know how
to do.

Tina it's time to wake up let's go
to the bathroom to clean up let's get
out of bed.

I don't want to get out of
bed. I don't want to get ready.

Come on not again please don't give me a hard
time. Your bed is wet you need to wash up
it's 9:00 a.m. it's time for your
breakfast and medication.

I don't feel like it. I don't need your help.

Stop it and calm down.

Don't touch me. How dare you telling me what to do. I don't need
your help.

I am just doing my job let's get ready for the day.

I don't need you. G out of my house and leave me alone.

People can become aggressive for many
reasons. It may be an expression of pain
fear frustration depression or anger.
People with dementia may not understand
when you're asking them to do and become
frustrated. They may genuinely not
understand when they need to do
something like take a pill or bathe.
Aggression usually isn't personal
although it certainly feels that way.
Reacting to aggression with anger shock
or yelling only escalates the situation.
First deescalate the situation by behaving calmly.
Identify yourself if you need to. It's
possible that your loved one does not
recognize you. Speak to the emotions that
might underlie the aggression. It could
be fear pain or frustration. Use
distraction encouragement reassurance
and try to be flexible if someone is
being uncooperative and angry.

Good morning Tina this is Jane your
caregiver. Your breakfast is ready would
do you like to eat downstairs.

I like my bed I want to stay here. You can bring my
breakfast here in bed.

I can do that. I see that your bed is wet though. I would
like to make your bed so you can rest
comfortably. Meanwhile would you like to
eat at the dining table.

No. I want to have my food here in bed.

Okay how about if you eat right over here just while I
make your bed.

Okay fine.

Here are a few tips on how to respond to
aggressive language and behavior.
Keep it simple. One instruction or
question at a time. Don't escalate
tensions by being bossy or yelling.
Instead use a calming tone of voice but
do not be condescending. Provide
reassurance. Let your loved one know
you're there for support.
Keep your body language positive and use
calming gestures and gentle touch give
ample time. Redirect or give ample time
and space for cooling off and reattempt
later. Remain safe back away slowly if
the behavior is threatening. Remove or
lock away all weapons like guns and
knives. Call 9-1-1 if physical aggression
cannot be redirected and your loved one
is a danger to themselves and others.
