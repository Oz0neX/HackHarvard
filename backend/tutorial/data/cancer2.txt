After Treatment
The end of treatment doesn’t always signal the end of
trauma or side effects caused by a cancer diagnosis and
treatment. Oftentimes, it becomes necessary to find a
“new normal,” both for you and your loved one.
Finding a New Normal
A “new normal” refers to what life looks like after cancer
treatment ends. For some, not much may change. For
others, life may be totally different after cancer.
Define your new normal
• It’s okay to bring parts of your “before cancer” life into
your “after cancer” life. Remember, you don’t have to completely throw
out everything from your “before” life. Likewise, you
don’t have to ignore certain changes you may have
experienced during treatment. Try to find a balance
between your pre-cancer and post-cancer lives.
Engage in post-treatment care
• Follow-up appointments are very important so the
doctor can keep an eye on the patient’s condition. Just
because treatment has ended doesn’t mean cancer
care is over. If you plan to continue operating in a
caregiver role post-treatment, you may need to set
some new boundaries with the patient. It’s possible
to still be available for the patient as needed, while
setting boundaries that work within your physical and
emotional capacity. If you will no longer be operating
in a caregiver capacity after treatment ends, be sure to
clearly communicate that change to your loved one.

The Cancer Caregiver Guide
• Continue to help the patient organize their
medications, appointments, insurance and bills, etc.
When appropriate, pass this system off to the patient
so they’re empowered with the information you’ve been
keeping.
• Help the patient stick to healthy habits recommended
by the doctor, such as nutrition and exercise
Keep in mind that emotional needs can persist or
even arise after a patient’s treatment is over

Consider joining a support group that can help you with
what to expect when finding and adjusting to a new
normal after caregiving.
